# Hi there 👋, I'm Aleksandr Oleinikov!

🚀 **Front-End Developer** by day, trail runner and road biker by… well, whenever the trails and roads call! I’m here to make the web faster, prettier, and a whole lot more fun to use. If you’re into seamless UI/UX, snappy designs, and a bit of code wizardry, we’re already friends. 😄

## ⚡ Fun Facts

- 🐶 I’m obsessed with dogs. One day, I’ll have two, and they’ll probably judge my code.  
- 🌄 I run trails and hit the road on my bike to recharge my creativity. Nature > coffee (most of the time).  
- 🚗 Road trips are my love language. Bonus points if I can brainstorm app ideas along the way.  
- **Dream username**: Something like *CyberAlexLegend77* (but sadly, that’s taken).
